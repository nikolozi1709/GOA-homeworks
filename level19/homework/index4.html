    <p><i>Abbott's babbler was described by the English zoologist Edward Blyth in 1845 and given the binomial name Malacocincla abbotti.
        [2] The genus name Malacocincla combines the Ancient Greek malakos meaning "soft" with modern Latin cinclus, meaning "thrush";
        referring to the birds' full and drooping plumage. The specific name abbotti was chosen by Blyth to honour the specimen collector,
        Lieutenant Colonel J. R. Abbott (1811–1888), who served in British India as Assistant Commissioner of the Arakan from 1837 to 1845.
        [3] Blyth erected the new genus Malacocincla for this species, but subsequent workers placed the species in Turdinus and Trichastoma.
        A revision reinstated its placement in Malacocincla in 1985. A 2001 study confirmed the cohesiveness of the Trichastoma group but a 2012 study shows that M.
        abbotti and M. sepiaria are in a clade along with Napothera, while M.
        cinereiceps and M. malaccensis fall into a different clade along with the genus Trichastoma and several species of Pellorneum.
        [4][5][6] An isolated population occurs in the Visakhapatnam Ghats, well separated from the.S.R.
        Krishna Raju by Dillon Ripley and Bruc nearest main distribution along the Himalayas and was named after Indian ornithologist Ke Beehler in 1985.
        [7] The nominate population is from southern Myanmar and extends to southern Tenasserim and northwestern Malaya including the Langkawi Islands.
        Several other populations of this widespread species have been named as subspecies and not all are recognized.
        The population in the eastern Himalayas from eastern Nepal to Sikkim and Assam was named as amabile, but is now considered within the nominate subspecies.
        Others include altera (central Laos and Annam), williamsoni (eastern Thailand and northwestern Cambodia), obscurior (coastal southeastern Thailand),
        olivaceum (Peninsular Thailand and Malaya), sirense (Borneo, Pulau Mata Siri), and baweanum (Bawean Island).[8]</i></p>

        <h1>#2Abbott's booby</h1>
        <img id="lasha" src="Abbott's_Booby.jpg"width="500" lenght="500">
        <p><i>Abbott's booby (Papasula abbotti) is an endangered seabird of the sulid family, which includes gannets and boobies.
                It is a large booby and is placed within its own monotypic genus. It was first identified from a specimen collected by William Louis Abbott,
                who discovered it on Assumption Island in 1892.
                Abbott's booby breeds only in a few spots on the Australian territory of Christmas Island in the eastern Indian Ocean,
                although it formerly had a much wider range. It has white plumage with black markings, and is adapted for long-distance flight.
                It forages around Christmas Island, often around nutrient-rich oceanic upwellings, although individuals can travel for thousands of kilometres.
                Pairs mate for life and raise one chick every two or three years, nesting near the top of emergent trees in the rainforest canopy.
                The population is decreasing. Historically, much of its former habitat was logged to make way for phosphate mining. Some logging continues,
                and the effects of the former logging continue to adversely affect the current population. Another threat has been caused by the introduction of yellow crazy ants
                which decrease habitat quality. Minimal habitat declines have a significant effect on the bird population. All nesting areas have been included in a national park.</i></p>

        <h1>#3Abbott's starling</h1>
        <img id="davita" src="Abbott's_Starling_(adult).jpg" width="500" lenght="500">
        <p><i>Abbott's starling (Arizelopsar femoralis) is a species of starling in the family Sturnidae. It is found in Kenya and Tanzania.
             Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist montane forests. It is threatened by habitat loss, and its population is estimated at 2500–9999.
            [2] This species, at 16 to 18 cm (6.3 to 7.1 in) long, is the smallest species of starling.[3] It is in the monotypic genus Arizelopsar.
The name of the species commemorates William Louis Abbott (1860-1936), an American naturalist and collector, who studied the wildlife of the Indo-Malayan region.
Description
The Abbott's starling has a black head and breast with white underparts and a yellow eye. Its voice is a musical whistled call moving up and down the scale.[citation needed]
Diet
The Abbott's starling feeds on insects and fruit, including the fruit of Cornus volkensii.[4]
Conservation and status
Abbott's starling is listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).
 As of 2020, their population is determined to be decreasing, with an estimated 1,000—2,500 mature individuals in the wild.
  Deforestation due to illegal logging and agriculture are considered major threats to Abbott's starling.[1]
