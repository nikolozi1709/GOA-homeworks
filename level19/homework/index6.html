        BMW M, that has been built since 2014. As part of the renumbering that splits the coup√© and convertible variants of the 3 Series into the 4 Series,
        the M4 replaced those variants of the BMW M3. Upgrades over the standard BMW 4 Series include an upgraded engine, suspension,
        exhaust system, brakes and weight reduction measures including increased use of carbon fiber, such as on the roof of the car, and the door cards.
        [1] The M4 also had a Competition Sport Lightweight (CSL) version that was 100kg lighter than the standard M4.</p>
