    <p>The BMW M5 is a super high-performance variant of the BMW 5 Series marketed under the BMW M sub-brand.
        It is considered an iconic vehicle in the sports saloon category.[1][2] The M5 has always been produced in the saloon (sedan, US English) body style,
        but in some countries the M5 has also been available as an estate/touring (wagon, US English) from 1992 to 1995, from 2006 to 2010, and since 2024.[3][4][5]
        The first M5 model was hand-built beginning in late 1984 on the E28 535i chassis with a modified engine from the M1 that made it the fastest production saloon at the time.
        M5 models have been produced for every generation of the 5 Series since 1984, with occasional gaps in production (1995 to 1998, 2023 to 2024).</p>
